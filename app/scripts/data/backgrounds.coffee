  name: "Adeptus Administratum"
  description: "Such is the size and scope of the Imperium that it takes an innumerable legion of scribes, officials, and bureaucrats to maintain it. Connected across the stars on a web of scribbled notes and secret data caches, the Administratum is a lumbering behemoth, churning at a speed only slightly higher than deathly rest as it ensures that every planet has paid its due and contributed to the Imperium’s continuation. Without the Administratum, the Imperium would dissolve into madness and mayhem. It would be cut off not only from those hidden hands that guide its wealth and resources, but also from its history and the centuries of secrets kept deep within the data vaults of the Imperium’s largest organisation."
,
  name: "Adeptus Arbites"
  description: "Only through constant vigilance and the execution of brutal law can the Imperium survive, and the Adeptus Arbites carries out this function. While the armies of the Imperial Guard struggle to hold back the aggression of alien empires and protect worlds from without, the Adeptus Arbites roots out rebels, recidivists, and threats to the stability of the Imperium from within. Its agents, collectively known as Arbitrators, operate as they best see fit, using their greater training and weaponry to tackle foes that might be beyond the scope of local agencies, or in many cases to deal with a government which has itself become corrupted. Remorseless and single-minded, they do not forgive or forget any crime, and pursue their quarry relentlessly until the Emperor’s Justice has been served."
,
  name: "Adeptus Astra Telepathica"
  description: "Psykers are a vital part of the Imperium, linking its worlds together, aiding its soldiers in battle, and guiding its ships across the stars. They are also dangerous, for the very gift that allows them to draw power from the Warp, that otherworldly realm that exists beneath reality, can also make them conduits for its unholy power and gateways for Daemons. An untrained psyker can bring doom upon an entire world if his abilities are not kept in check. The Imperium has a rigid structure in place to watch for any who display even a hint of psychic talent and remove them from society, usually through force. Once in custody, they are trained to serve the Emperor or, if they prove too unstable, destroyed for the good of Mankind. The Adeptus Astra Telepathica oversees psykers within the Imperium, scouring the galaxy for new psykers and then examining and training their catches. Those that are not worthy to live must instead serve the Emperor directly, their life energies sustaining His continued existence for one more day."
,
  name: "Adeptus Mechanicus"
  description: "Much of Mankind’s mastery over technology has been forgotten, and what remains are closely guarded secrets, held in jealous hands of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Wrapped up in superstitious beliefs and rites, the knowledge of how to operate the Imperium’s most advanced devices falls to these followers of the Machine God. The Adeptus Mechanicus guards and oversees the ancient knowledge and the mysteries of making technology function, for even its dogmatic and superstitious understandings are far beyond those of anyone else in the Imperium. They embrace technology to such a degree that they try to transcend the flesh of their bodies with the purity of metal. To those outside the Mechanicum, they can appear unfeeling and emotionless, more akin to their blessed machines than to other humans, and most would welcome such views."
,
  name: "Adeptus Ministorum"
  description: "The Adeptus Ministorum, also known as the Ecclesiarchy, is the religion that venerates the Emperor of Mankind. Powerful and ancient, it embodies the Imperial Creed, the myriad systems of belief that bind humanity together, gives it purpose, and keeps it safe from soul-imperilling threats both within and without. Its members are devoted servants of the Emperor, dedicated to bringing His word to the faithful, and rooting out any which would stand against Him. Whether with words or deeds, a member of the Adeptus Ministorum never forgets his earlier service. Even should he fall from grace, the teachings of the church remain branded upon his soul, and the fire of the Emperor’s faith still burns strong in his belly."
,
  name: "Imperial Guard"
  description: "To protect the Imperium from its many enemies, the Imperium maintains a massive fighting force known as the Imperial Guard. Tithed from the worlds across the galaxy, the Imperial Guard is an immense force of countless billions, always at constant war, and always recruiting more soldiers to replace the fallen. No accurate records exist as to its exact size and strength, and such is its nature that it is in constant flux, troops moving from system to system or scattered across the stars fighting wars long forgotten. Many Guardsmen do not live even a full day after entering battle, but those who survive become hardened combat veterans skilled in the bringing of death and facing the worst foes the galaxy has to offer. Scarred and broken, such veterans can hope for little comfort beyond the battlefield, but may find service in other parts of the Imperial war machine or more secretive duties in less overt wars."
,
  name: "Outcast"
  description: "Even within the Imperium, where most are born into the same position for life, there are those that work their way free to make a life on their own terms. Some may have deliberately forsaken the role they were given, or slipped between the cracks of their ossified civilisation. They exist as criminals, vagabonds, and renegades on the fringes of Imperial life. These Outcasts live in the shadows of society, living by their wits and charm. They are able thieves, assassins, and bounty hunters; suspicion and fear often dogs their steps, as others know that where they tread, crime follows. Despite the epithet, Outcasts can be connected to all levels of Imperial life, and while their concerns are primarily for themselves, they can be enlisted to larger pursuits. They have connections, knowledge, and skills unheard of for proper Imperial citizens, and the willingness to use them through bribery, coercion, or other base appeals often more effective than simple calls to Imperial duty. They can also retain associations and bonds with their previous lives and organisations that allow them to operate across many strata of Imperial life."
