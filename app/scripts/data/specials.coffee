  "accurate": "+10 to BS when aiming"
  "balanced": "+10 to WS when parrying"
  "blast": "When working out a hit from a Blast weapon, anyone within the weapon’s blast radius in metres, indicated by the number in parentheses, is also suffers a single hit from the weapon. Roll damage once and apply it to each character affected by the blast. A Blast weapon also scatters when the user fails his Ballistic Skill test when firing it"
  "concussive": "When a target is struck by a Concussive weapon, he must take a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X)"
  "corrosive": "If a target is struck by an attack from a Corrosive weapon, the Armour points of any armour worn by the target in that location are reduced by 1d10 points. If the Armour points of the armour are reduced below 0 or the target is not wearing any armour in that location, the excess amount of Armour point damage (or the whole amount if the target is wearing no armour in that location) is dealt to the target. This excess damage is not reduced by Toughness."
  "crippling": "When a target suffers at least one wound from this weapon, he is considered Crippled for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all damage. If a Crippled character takes more than a Half Action on his turn, he suffers Rending damage equal to the number in parentheses (X) to the Hit Location that suffered the original damage. This damage is not reduced by Armour or Toughness."
  "defensive": "A Defensive weapon, such as a shield, is intended to be used to block attacks and is awkward when used to attack. A weapon with this quality grants a +15 bonus to tests made when used to Parry, but imposes a –10 penalty on tests to make attacks with it."
  "felling": "Felling weapons make a mockery of even the most resilient enemies, cutting dense tissue and bone with ease. When calculating damage from Felling weapons, reduce the target’s Unnatural Toughness bonus by the number in parentheses (X). Felling only reduces Unnatural Toughness, not the target’s base Toughness bonus, and does not persist once the damage has been calculated."
  "flame": "Using materials such as promethium and incendiary powders, this weapon ignites with primordial fire. Whenever a target is struck by an attack with this quality (even if he suffers no damage), he must make an Agility test or be set on fire (see page 243). If the target of the Flame attack is a vehicle, the pilot must make the appropriate Operate skill test with a bonus equal to the vehicle’s Armour value on the facing hit by the Flame attack. If the pilot fails, the vehicle immediately catches fire (see the On Fire! sidebar on page 263)."
  "flexible": "These are often made of linked metal, rope, or other non-rigid materials that deny defensive counters. They cannot be Parried, though they themselves can be used to Parry an opponent’s weapon."
  "force": "A force weapon relies on the user’s mind to unlock its true potential, suddenly turning a sword or staff into a device burning with eldritch energies able to reave tanks. Force weapons count as Best craftsmanship Mono variants of the equivalent Low-Tech weapon. In the hands of a psyker, the weapon also deals bonus damage and gains bonus penetration equal to the psyker’s base psy rating (so a psy rating 3 would grant +3 damage and +3 penetration), and the damage type changes to Energy. In addition, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he may take a Focus Power action (Opposed with Willpower) as a Half Action. If he wins the test, then for every degree of success, the Force weapon’s wielder deals an additional 1d10 Energy damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus. Psykers always use their base psy rating when determining psychic strength for this test, and cannot generate Psychic Phenomena on this test. Force weapons cannot be destroyed by weapons with the Power Field quality."
  "graviton": "Graviton weapons alter the target’s local gravity field, transforming protective armour into crushing force. When a weapon with the Graviton quality hits a target, it inflicts additional damage equal to the target’s Armour points on the struck location. If the target is a vehicle or cover, it instead inflicts additional damage equal to the Armour points of the facing that the attack struck. Vehicles that suffer Critical damage from Graviton weapons always roll on the Motive Systems Critical Effects table, no matter what location was actually hit."
  "hallucinogenic": "Where most weapons seek to harm the body, those with this quality seek to damage the mind with exotic chemicals and neurotoxic drugs. When a creature is struck by a weapon with the Hallucinogenic quality, it must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer a temporary delusion and roll 1d10 on Table 5–3: Hallucinogenic Effects. Respirators and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this test. The effects last for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every degree of failure."
  "haywire": "A foul affront to the Omnissiah in the eyes of many Tech-Priests, devices with this quality seek to cripple machine spirits and make metal as weak as flesh. Everything within the field’s radius, indicated by the number in parentheses, is affected; Haywire (3), for example, would affect an area with a three metre radius. Roll 1d10 on Table 5–4: Haywire Field Effects (adding any modifiers from the weapon) to determine the strength of the effect. As the field slowly dissipates, the strength lessens one step in severity each round until it becomes Insignificant (i.e., a result of Major Disruption would become Minor Disruption the following round and then cease to have an effect the round after that). Additional Haywire attacks in the same area do not stack but instead create a new effect that is either ignored if lower than the current effect or replaces the old one if higher."
  "inaccurate": "Poorly manufactured with often shoddy construction, inaccurate weapons are common in underhive gangs and heretical cults. A character gains no benefit from the Aim action when attacking with a weapon with this quality."
  "indirect": ""
  "lance": "Lance weapons focus devastating energy, piercing armour with ease. Weapons with this quality have a variable penetration value that is dependent on the accuracy of each shot. When a target is hit by a weapon with the Lance quality, increase the weapon’s penetration value by its base value once for each degree of success the attacker achieves. For example, if a Lance weapon had a base penetration value of 5 and hit with three degrees of success (adding 3x5=15), the total penetration for the attack would be 20."
  "maximal": "Many energy weapons have multiple settings, allowing the user greater tactical flexibility in combat. As a Free Action, this weapon can be switched between two modes: Standard (which uses the normal weapon profile) and Maximal. When the weapon is fired on Maximal, it adds 10 metres to its range, 1d10 to its damage, and +2 to its penetration. If it has the Blast quality, then the value of this quality is increased by 2 (i.e., Blast [3] becomes Blast [5]). The weapon also uses three times the normal amount of ammunition per shot and gains the Recharge quality."
  "melta": "These weapons rely on intense heat to negate protective armour, turning even the thickest to steaming liquid. This weapon doubles its penetration when firing at Short range or closer."
  "overheats": "Through inefficient shielding, defective venting, or simply inherent design, the weapon often becomes overcome with the heat of its ammunition or firing methods. On an attack roll of 91 or higher, this weapon overheats. The wielder suffers Energy damage equal to the weapon’s damage with a penetration of 0 to an arm location (the arm holding the weapon if the weapon was fired one-handed, or a random arm if the weapon was fired with two hands). The wielder may choose to avoid taking the damage by dropping the weapon as a Free Action. A weapon that overheats must spend the round afterwards cooling down, and cannot be fired again until the second round after overheating. A weapon with this quality does not jam, and any effect that would cause the weapon to jam instead causes the weapon to overheat."
  "power field": "Power fields form a cloud of disruptive energy, allowing a weapon to strike with terrible force. When the character successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack made with a weapon that lacks this quality, roll 1d100; on a result of 26 or higher, he destroys the attacker’s weapon. Weapons with the Warp Weapon or Force quality, and Natural Weapons, are immune to this effect."
  "primitive": "Crude and basic in design, these kinds of weapons, while still deadly, are less effective against modern armour. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result greater than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. For example, a weapon with Primitive (7) would count all damage rolls of 8, 9 or 10 as 7. These weapons can still generate Righteous Fury (see page 227) as normal, on a damage roll of 10."
  "proven": "These weapons always inflict massive trauma. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result lower than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. Thus, a Proven (3) weapon would treat any die result of 1 or 2 as a 3 for the purposes of calculating damage."
  "razor sharp": "Certain weapons or ammunition types have the ability to slice right through armour if they hit just right. If the wielder scores three or more degrees of success when attacking with this weapon, the weapon’s penetration value is doubled when resolving any hits from that attack."
  "recharge": "Some weapons lack continuous power or ammunition supplies, and each strike drains capacitors or empties fuel reservoirs. When a weapon with this quality is used to make an attack, that weapon cannot be used to attack again until the end of the next round (in effect, it can only be used once every other round)."
  "reliable": "Using ancient and well-consecrated designs, reliable weapons bring glory to the Omnissiah with each attack. Reliable weapons only jam on an unmodified result of 100. Reliable weapons with the Spray quality, or which do not make hit rolls, never jam."
  "sanctified": "These weapons are blessed against the forces of Chaos. Any damage inflicted by a Sanctified weapon counts as Holy damage, which can have unique effects against some terrible Daemons and other denizens of the Warp."
  "scatter": "The standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired, ripping apart targets at close range but inflicting considerably less harm from afar. When fired at Point Blank range, this weapon gains +10 to hit and deals +3 damage. When fired at Short range, it gains +10 to hit. At any longer ranges, it suffers –3 damage."
  "shocking": "Shocking weapons can incapacitate their opponents with a powerful surge of energy or other non-lethal means. A target that takes at least 1 point of damage from a Shocking weapon (after Armour and Toughness bonus) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he fails, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of his degrees of failure (rounding up)."
  "smoke": "Rather than inflicting damage, these weapons throw up dense clouds to create cover. When a hit is scored from a weapon with this quality, it creates a smokescreen at the point of impact with a radius in metres equal to the number in parentheses (X). This screen lasts for 1d10+10 rounds, or a shorter time in adverse weather conditions (see the effects of smoke on page 229)."
  "snare": "These ensnaring devices use masses of fibrous webbing, adhesive fluids, and other entangling materials to bring an enemy down. When a target is struck by a weapon with this quality, it must make an Agility test with a penalty equal ten times the number in parentheses (X) or be Immobilised. For example, a weapon with Snare (1) would impose a –10 penalty on this test. An Immobilised target can attempt no actions other than trying to escape the bonds. As a Full Action, he can make a Challenging (+0) Strength or Agility test, with a penalty equal to ten times the number in parentheses (X). If he succeeds, he bursts free or wriggles out. The target is considered Helpless (see page 229) until he escapes."
  "spray": "Spray weapons use large area-effect shots to strike more foes, sacrificing range for wider coverage. Unlike other weapons,they have just one range and, when fired, hit all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to test Ballistic Skill; all creatures in the weapon’s path (a cone-shaped area extending in a 30° arc from the firer out to the weapon’s range) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility test or suffer one hit from the weapon. If the wielder does not possess the appropriate Weapon Training talent, targets gain a +20 bonus on the test; this rises to +30 if the weapon is Heavy and the wielder is not braced. Cover does not protect from Spray attacks unless it completely conceals a target. Because there is no attack roll, they are always considered to strike the Body location. They jam if the firer rolls a 9 on any damage dice (before any modifiers are applied). Due to the inaccurate nature of their design, they cannot be used to make Called Shot actions."
  "storm": "Firing with a hail of shots, these weapons strike so rapidly that enemies are filled with metal in an instant. This quality doubles the number of hits the weapon inflicts on the target and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when firing a weapon with the Storm quality in fully automatic mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (up to the weapon’s firing rate, as normal)."
  "tearing": "These weapons call on spinning chainblades, serrated claws, burrowing projectiles, and other vicious means to rip apart targets. These weapons roll one extra die for damage, and the lowest result is discarded."
  "toxic": "Filled with malignant chemicals and fast acting poisons, toxic weapons bring down enemies through virulence and sickness. At the end of his turn, if a character has suffered damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in the last round from a weapon with this quality, he must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer 1d10 additional damage (of the same type as the first weapon with this quality to damage him that round). For example, a weapon with Toxic (4) imposes a –40 on the tests to resist its effects. Some weapons or creatures carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more damage, as indicated in their individual descriptions."
  "twin-linked": "A Twin-Linked weapon represents two identical weapons connected together and set to fire at the same time, increasing the chances of scoring a hit by blasting more shots at the target. A weapon with this quality gains a +20 to hit when fired and uses twice as much ammunition. In addition, the weapon scores one additional hit if the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees of success. When emptied, the weapon’s reload time is doubled."
  "unbalanced": "Cumbersome, awkward to use, and often heavy, these are usually powerful offensively, but suffer in defence actions such as parrying. These weapons cannot be used to make Lighting Attack actions, and impose a –10 penalty when used to Parry."
  "unreliable": "A clear affront to the Omnissiah, Unreliable devices represent poorly designed, badly manufactured, or improperly consecrated weapons that are perhaps better than no weapon at all, but not by a great measure. An Unreliable weapon suffers a jam on a roll of 91 or higher, even if fired on Semi- or Full Auto."
  "vengeful": "These weapons seemingly embody the Emperor’s wrath, and eagerly strike down any who would stand against His servants. When attacking with this weapon, the attacker triggers Righteous Fury (see page 227) on any damage die result with a value of X or higher (before any modifiers are applied)."
