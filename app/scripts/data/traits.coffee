  1:
    name: "Dark Sight"
    description: "Some species are sensitive to different wavelengths of light than man, and can detect sights otherwise invisible. A creature with this trait sees normally even in areas of total darkness, and never takes a penalty for fighting in areas of dim or no lighting."
  2:
    name: "Machine"
    description: "A creature with this trait is fashioned from inorganic materials and is generally more rigorous then fleshy beings. Machines do not breathe, are immune to vacuum, extremes of cold, and mind-influencing psychic effects. Machines have a certain number of Armour points (indicated by the number in parentheses). This armour stacks with worn armour, but not with the Natural Armour trait, and can damage from Fire (see page 243)."
  3:
    name: "Regeneration"
    description: "Physiological enhancements, mutations, xenos physiology, and even Warp-corruption can all result in organisms that heal from injury at an inconceivable pace. Each round, at the start of its turn, the creature can make a Toughness test to remove an amount of damage indicated in the parentheses after the trait."
  4:
    name: "Touched By the Fates"
    description: "Where the naive might see only luck, those who have glimpsed the true nature of the galaxy can see when powers outside this realm have made their favour known. The NPC has a number of Fate points shown in parentheses (X). It can use these Fate points in exactly the same way as Player Characters and can even burn a Fate point to survive death and destruction at the GM’s discretion. The NPC’s attacks also use the rules for Righteous Fury."
  5:
    name: "Baneful Presence"
    description: "The creature’s very existence is anathema to nearby mortals, and permeates its surroundings with the taint of the unnatural. All characters suffer a –10 penalty to Willpower tests taken while within X metres of the creature."
  6:
    name: "Daemonic"
    description: "Daemonic creatures are denizens of the Warp, but can manifest in real space either through sheer strength of will, hunger, or occult rituals. Creatures with this trait increase their Toughness bonus against all damage by the number indicated in the parentheses (X), in the same manner as an Unnatural Characteristic (see page 139), and stack if the latter also increases Toughness. This increase is negated by damage inflicted from force weapons, psychic powers, holy attacks, or other creatures with this trait.\n\nIf the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power test, roll on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena (see page 196), adding +10 to the total. He is not affected unless it causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him might be.\n\nCan add up to +3 to PR. Roll on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena (see page 196)at+10per+1PRadded,uptoa maximum of +30. He is not affected unless it causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him might be.\n\n+10 to all rolls on Table 6–2: Psychic Phenomena (see page 196), decrease psy rating by 1 per power. He is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him might be."
  7:
    name: "Fear"
    description: "A creature with this trait has an unnerving appearance. Some prey upon humanity’s visceral terrors, while others depend on the inherent corruptive power of the Warp. The Fear trait always has an associated rating (1–4) to reflect how awful the creature is to behold; this is indicated by the number in parentheses (X). The higher the Fear rating, the harder it is for others to resist going insane from the encounter, as shown on Table 4–5: Fear Rating. When a character encounters a creature with this trait, the character must make a Willpower test with a penalty based on the creature’s Fear rating. If he succeeds, the character suffers no ill effects; if he fails, he must roll on Table 8-11: Shock (see page 287), adding +10 to the roll for every degree of failure on the test."
  8:
    name: "From Beyond"
    description: "Some creatures are free from the limitations of normal physiology, having emerged from the impossible realm of the Warp or perhaps using bodies forged from cold metal and circuitry. Their minds are beyond the petty frailties and precarious sanity of a mortal mind. Such a creature is immune to Fear, Pinning, Insanity points, and psychic powers used to cloud, control, or delude its mind."
  9:
    name: "Hoverer"
    description: "Creatures with this trait have a limited capability for flight, flying no higher than two metres. The number in parentheses (X) indicates its speed when hovering; this number replaces its Agility bonus for purposes of calculating Movement while airborne. For more details on flying, see page 249 of Chapter VII: Combat."
  10:
    name: "Size"
    description: "Creatures come in one of ten different size categories, as shown on Table 4–6: Size. Size affects movement, how well the creature can hide and move undetected, and how easy or hard it is to strike in combat. When calculating movement, apply the size modifier first, and then other modifiers from other traits or talents (such as Quadruped). Note that a creature’s movement cannot be reduced to less than 1."
  11:
    name: "Psyker"
    description: "Whether due to unnatural influences, the study of forbidden lore, or simply sheer force of will, this individual is a psyker. Though this trait has no benefits on its own, it allows characters to purchase the Psyniscience skill and psychic powers. All psykers have a psy rating (or PR; see page 193) which is listed out for each NPC."
  12:
    name: "Unnatural Strength"
    description: "One or more of the creature’s characteristics is unnaturally enhanced. This is indicated by a number that is then added directly to the relevant Characteristic bonus. Successful tests using a characteristic tied to this trait gain a number of bonus degrees of success equal to half the Unnatural Characteristic value."
