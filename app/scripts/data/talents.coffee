  1:
    name: "Furious Assault"
    description: "The Acolyte launches a furious attack on his foe, the rage of the Emperor powering his assault. Once per turn, after resolving an All Out Attack action that successfully hits, the character may make a second All Out Attack action against the same target as a Free Action, with the same bonuses and penalties as the first."
  2:
    name: "Thunder Charge"
    description: "he Acolyte charges into combat using his body as an additional weapon. Driven by his rage and momentum, the impact of such a charge can knock foes flying or bring them to their knees. When he makes a Charge action, he can barrel through enemies to get to his target. The character makes an Opposed Strength test against each foe in his way (those who his movement would take him past or through). Each foe that loses the Opposed test is knocked Prone. After resolving these Opposed tests, the character’s Charge action resolves against his original target as normal."
  3:
    name: "Warp Sense"
    description: "The Acolyte’s senses have evolved to perceive the Warp in parallel with the physical world. The character can use the Psyniscience Skill as a Free Action instead of as a Half Action. He can also passively detect psychic effects and entities without the need to actively seek them out. Whenever the character could detect such a Warp signature or a creature, the GM can allow him to make a Psyniscience skill test to detect it, in the same way he could use Awareness to spot an ambush without knowing it is there."
  4:
    name: "Die Hard"
    description: "Through either mental resolve or sheer stubbornness, the Acolyte refuses to fall. When this character would suffer a level of Fatigue due to the Blood Loss condition, he makes a Challenging (+0) Willpower test; if he succeeds, he does not suffer a level of Fatigue."
  5:
    name: "Luminen Shock"
    description: "The energies charged in the Acolyte’s Luminen Capacitors can be expelled by touching a foe. The character always counts as being equipped with a melee weapon that inflicts 1d10 plus his WPB in Energy damage, with Pen 0 and the Shocking quality. He always counts as having Weapon Training for it and after making this attack, he must pass a Toughness test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue."
  6:
    name: "Technical Knock"
    description: "Either through the ease of long practice, or the proper ritual to appease a weapon’s machine spirit, the Acolyte can clear stoppages with a simple knock or solid smack of his hand to a weapon. Once per round, he may attempt to unjam a gun (see page 224) as a Half Action rather than a Full Action. He must touch the weapon to make use of this talent."
  7:
    name: "True Grit"
    description: "The Acolyte is able to shrug off wounds that would fell lesser men. Whenever he suffers Critical damage (after reduction for Armour and Toughness), reduce the amount by his Toughness bonus (to a minimum of 1 damage)."
